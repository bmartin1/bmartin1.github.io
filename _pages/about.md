I recently joined Microsoft :smile:. Before I received a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University on the topic of Machine Learning for Audio Signal Processing, supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj and Prof. Ian Lane. Previously, I worked as a Staff Researcher at ICSI - UC Berkeley in the Audio & Multimedia Lab. I received my masters and undergrad degree from ITESM.

My research focuses on Acoustic Intelligence, Audio Analytics and Sound Understanding.
