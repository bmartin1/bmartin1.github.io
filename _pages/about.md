I recently joined Microsoft. Before I received a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University on the topic of Machine Learning for Audio Signal Processing, supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj and Prof. Ian Lane. Previously, I worked as a Staff Researcher at ICSI - UC Berkeley in the Audio & Multimedia Lab. My research focuses on Acoustic Intelligence, Audio Analytics and Sound Understanding.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
